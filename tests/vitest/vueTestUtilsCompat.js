 * Vue Test Utils v1 -> v2 mount-options adapter.
 *
 * VTU v2 moved the per-mount environment options under a `global` key:
 *
 *   v1: mount(C, { stubs, provide, mocks, directives, plugins, components })
 *   v2: mount(C, { global: { stubs, provide, mocks, directives, plugins, components } })
 *
 * v2 does not warn or throw on the v1 shape — it SILENTLY IGNORES those keys.
 * A spec that stubs a heavy child still mounts the real child, a spec that
 * provides an injection key mounts without it, and the failure surfaces far
 * away as a confusing assertion or a null-deref inside an unrelated component.
 * Several spec files here use the v1 shape.
 *
 * Rewriting them by hand is a large structural edit with a real chance of
 * silently changing what a spec asserts. This adapter hoists the v1 keys into
 * `global` at call time, preserving each spec's intent exactly, and is
 * trivially reversible: `vitest.config.js` aliases `@vue/test-utils` here, so
 * deleting the alias restores stock behaviour.
 *
 * It is a migration aid, not a permanent fixture — specs should move to the
 * native `global: { … }` shape over time, and this file deleted once
 * `grep -rE '^\s+(stubs|provide|mocks): ' tests/ src/` comes back empty.
 *
 * `propsData` is deliberately NOT touched: v2 still accepts it as an alias
 * for `props`.
 */

// Import the real module by absolute path — importing '@vue/test-utils' here
// would hit the vitest alias that points at this file and recurse forever.
