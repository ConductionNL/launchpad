# Agenda Management Specification

## Purpose

Agenda management handles the creation, ordering, and conduct of meeting agendas. An agenda is a structured list of items to be discussed at a meeting, each with a type (informational, discussion, decision), allocated time, and attached documents. The system supports drag-and-drop reordering, legally required items for specific meeting types (e.g., ALV statutory items), and real-time agenda tracking during meetings.

**Standards**: Schema.org (`ItemList`, `ListItem`), Akoma Ntoso (`debateSection`, `pointOfOrder`), OpenRaadsinformatie (`AgendaPunt`)
**Feature tier**: MVP

## Data Model

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full AgendaItem entity definition including property tables, Schema.org mappings, and OpenRaadsinformatie alignment.

## Requirements

---

### Requirement: Agenda Item Creation

The system MUST support creating agenda items with a title, type (informational, discussion, decision), description, allocated time, presenter, and attached documents. Agenda items MUST be stored as OpenRegister objects in the `decidesk` register using the `agendaItem` schema.

**Feature tier**: MVP

#### Scenario: Create a decision agenda item

- GIVEN a user preparing an agenda for the board meeting
- WHEN they add an agenda item with title "Approve Q1 Budget", type "decision", allocated time 20 minutes, and presenter "CFO"
- THEN the system MUST create an OpenRegister object with the `agendaItem` schema
- AND the item MUST appear at the end of the agenda list
- AND the item MUST have a sequential order number

#### Scenario: Create an informational agenda item with documents

- GIVEN a user preparing a meeting agenda
- WHEN they add an agenda item with title "Management Report" and type "informational" and attach a PDF document
- THEN the document MUST be linked to the agenda item via Nextcloud Files
- AND meeting participants MUST be able to access the document

#### Scenario: Submit a member proposal for the agenda

- GIVEN a member of a governing body with an upcoming meeting
- WHEN they submit a motion or proposal for the agenda with title and supporting arguments
- THEN the proposal MUST be submitted for chair review
- AND the chair MUST be notified of the pending proposal
- AND the chair MUST be able to accept or reject the agenda addition

---

### Requirement: Agenda Ordering and Structure

The system MUST support drag-and-drop reordering of agenda items. The system MUST enforce legally required items for specific meeting types (e.g., ALV must include annual report, financial statements, kascommissie report, board elections). Sub-items MUST be supported for grouping related topics.

**Feature tier**: MVP

#### Scenario: Reorder agenda items via drag-and-drop

- GIVEN a meeting agenda with 5 items
- WHEN the user drags item 4 to position 2
- THEN the order numbers MUST update automatically for all items
- AND the new order MUST persist immediately

#### Scenario: Enforce legally required ALV agenda items

- GIVEN a meeting of type "general_assembly" for an association
- WHEN the user creates the agenda
- THEN the system MUST prompt to include required items: opening, approval of previous minutes, annual report, financial statements, kascommissie report, board elections, any other business, closing
- AND missing required items MUST be highlighted with a warning

#### Scenario: Group agenda items with sub-items

- GIVEN an agenda item "Committee Reports"
- WHEN the user adds sub-items "Finance Committee" and "Audit Committee"
- THEN the sub-items MUST appear nested under the parent item
- AND each sub-item MUST have its own allocated time, type, and presenter

---

### Requirement: Agenda Time Management

The system MUST calculate total meeting duration from individual item allocations. The system MUST warn when total allocated time exceeds a configured meeting length. During meetings, the system MUST track time spent per agenda item.

**Feature tier**: MVP

#### Scenario: Calculate total agenda duration

- GIVEN agenda items with allocated times of 10, 20, 15, 30, and 5 minutes
- WHEN the user views the agenda summary
- THEN the total duration MUST be displayed as "1 hour 20 minutes"
- AND if the meeting is scheduled for 1 hour, a warning MUST indicate the agenda exceeds the scheduled duration by 20 minutes

#### Scenario: Track time during meeting conduct

- GIVEN a meeting in progress on agenda item 3 of 5
- WHEN the allocated time for item 3 (15 minutes) has elapsed
- THEN the system MUST display a time-over indicator
- AND the chair MUST be able to extend the time or move to the next item

---

### Requirement: Agenda Document Package

The system MUST support assembling all agenda item documents into a single meeting package (vergaderstukken) for distribution to participants.

**Feature tier**: MVP

#### Scenario: Assemble meeting package from agenda documents

- GIVEN a meeting with 5 agenda items, each with one or more attached documents
- WHEN the secretary triggers "Assemble meeting package"
- THEN the system MUST create a structured document package with a table of contents
- AND documents MUST be organized by agenda item number and title
- AND the package MUST be available for download and distribution via convocation
