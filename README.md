# Rapid Application Development - Nextcloud Apps Environment

**A personal project by Ruben van der Linde**

This repository is part of the "Rapid Application Development" initiative - a personal project run in spare time to create an optimal Cursor AI development environment for quickly building Nextcloud applications using AI assistance.

The repository manages multiple Nextcloud applications developed by Conduction as a multi-repository project structure using git submodules, specifically optimized for AI-assisted development workflows. It also explores the possibility of reusing Conduction applications under their EUPL licensing as building blocks/components for other companies and developers. 

## Project Vision

The Rapid Application Development project aims to:

- **AI-First Development**: Leverage Cursor AI capabilities for rapid Nextcloud app creation
- **Streamlined Workflow**: Minimize setup friction and maximize development velocity  
- **Best Practices**: Maintain code quality while accelerating development cycles
- **Multi-Repository Management**: Coordinate multiple related applications efficiently
- **Documentation-Driven**: Generate comprehensive docs alongside code using AI
- **EUPL Component Reuse**: Explore using Conduction apps as building blocks under EUPL licensing
- **Zero-Dependency Strategy**: Enable other companies to use Conduction apps free of charge or responsibility

This environment is designed to enable building production-ready Nextcloud applications with AI assistance in record time, while maintaining professional development standards and exploring the potential of the Conduction ecosystem as a foundation for enterprise development.

## EUPL Licensing & Zero-Dependency Strategy

A key exploration area of this project is leveraging Conduction's EUPL-licensed applications as reusable building blocks. This approach offers several strategic advantages:

### For Companies & Developers:
- **Free Usage**: Utilize proven Nextcloud applications without licensing costs
- **Zero Responsibility**: No support obligations or maintenance requirements from Conduction
- **Production Ready**: Access to battle-tested, enterprise-grade components
- **Rapid Development**: Skip foundational development, focus on business logic

### For the Conduction Ecosystem:
- **Wider Adoption**: Increase usage and visibility of Conduction applications
- **Community Growth**: Foster a larger ecosystem of developers familiar with Conduction patterns
- **Validation**: Real-world usage provides valuable feedback and testing
- **Market Positioning**: Establish Conduction as the go-to foundation for Nextcloud development

This "zero-dependency" model allows other organizations to build upon Conduction's work while maintaining complete independence, potentially accelerating the adoption of both individual applications and the broader Nextcloud ecosystem.

## Conduction Applications

The following applications are managed as separate git repositories and included as submodules:

- **docudesk** - Document services (anonymisation, metadata enhancement)
- **larpingapp** - Custom app for LARP management
- **opencatalogi** - Cataloguing application
- **openconnector** - API endpoint creator
- **openregister** - Object-oriented datastore (all apps should use this for storage)
- **softwarecatalog** - Software catalog management
- **zaakafhandelapp** - Case handling application

```

## Setup Instructions

### Initial Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd apps-extra
   ```

2. Initialize and update all submodules:
   ```bash
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

### Working with Submodules

#### Update all submodules to latest:
```bash
git submodule update --remote --recursive
```

#### Update a specific submodule:
```bash
cd openregister
git pull origin main
cd ..
git add openregister
git commit -m "Update openregister to latest"
```

#### Add a new submodule:
```bash
git submodule add <repository-url> <app-name>
```

### Development Workflow

1. **Working on individual apps**: Navigate to the app directory and work normally with git
2. **Updating the main repository**: After changes in submodules, commit the submodule reference updates in the main repository
3. **Deployment**: Use `git submodule update --init --recursive` to ensure all submodules are at the correct versions

## Non-Conduction Apps

The following apps are present in the development environment but are gitignored as they are not part of the Conduction development scope:

- circles
- files_pdfviewer
- hmr_enabler
- profiler
- recommendations
- viewer
- dsonextcloud
- opencatalog

## Development Environment

This multi-repository setup is designed for:
- **Environment**: WSL with Docker containers
- **Database**: MySQL accessible via Docker
- **API**: Nextcloud API endpoints
- **Documentation**: Docusaurus (in individual app `website/` folders)

## Notes

- Each Conduction app should maintain its own documentation in `website/docs/`
- Use single quotes (') instead of backticks (`) in documentation due to Docusaurus limitations
- All apps should use openregister for data storage
- Follow the coding standards defined in `.cursor/rules/`

## About This Project

**Rapid Application Development** is a personal initiative by Ruben van der Linde, developed during spare time to explore the intersection of AI-assisted development and rapid application prototyping. 

The project serves as both a practical development environment and an experiment in maximizing development velocity through AI collaboration, specifically focused on the Nextcloud ecosystem. It also investigates the strategic potential of EUPL-licensed Conduction applications as a foundation for enterprise Nextcloud development, proving both the technical viability and business value of the "zero-dependency" component reuse model.
