# Resolution and Minutes Specification

## Purpose

Resolutions and minutes are the formal output of the decision-making process. A resolution is the legal text of an adopted decision, suitable for archival and external communication. Minutes (notulen) are the structured record of a meeting including attendance, discussions, decisions, votes, and action items. The system supports real-time minute-taking during meetings, automated generation from meeting data, review/approval workflows, and integration with Docudesk for professional document rendering.

**Standards**: Akoma Ntoso (`act`, `minutes`), Schema.org (`CreativeWork`, `DigitalDocument`), OpenRaadsinformatie (`Besluit`, `Verslag`), MDTO (metadata for archival)
**Feature tier**: V1
**Legal reference**: BW 2:10 (minutes of board meetings), Gemeentewet 23 (council minutes), Awb 3:46-3:47 (formal decision documentation)

## Data Model

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full Resolution and Minutes entity definitions including property tables and standards mappings.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Resolution Generation

The system MUST support generating formal resolution texts from adopted decisions. Resolutions MUST include the decision text, voting results, legal basis, date of adoption, and governing body. Resolutions MUST be stored as OpenRegister objects and optionally rendered as documents via Docudesk.

**Feature tier**: V1

#### Scenario: Generate a resolution from an adopted decision

- WHEN the secretary triggers "Generate Resolution"

- AND the resolution MUST have a unique sequential number per body (e.g., "2026-BES-042")
- AND the resolution MUST be available for export as PDF via Docudesk

#### Scenario: Generate a resolution with legal basis references

- GIVEN an adopted decision referencing Gemeentewet article 160
- WHEN the resolution is generated
- THEN the resolution MUST include the legal basis ("Gelet op artikel 160 van de Gemeentewet")
- AND the resolution text MUST follow Akoma Ntoso structure (preface, body, conclusions)

#### Scenario: Provide proof of proper adoption for notarial deed

- AND voting results MUST be automatically inserted from the voting system

#### Scenario: Record action items during minute-taking

- GIVEN the secretary is recording minutes for an agenda item

- THEN the action item MUST be linked to the agenda item and meeting
- AND the action item MUST appear in the action tracking system (see decision-management spec)

The system MUST support a review and approval workflow for minutes. Draft minutes MUST be distributed to participants for review. Participants MUST be able to suggest corrections. The chair or designated approver MUST formally approve the minutes.

**Feature tier**: V1

#### Scenario: Distribute draft minutes for review

- GIVEN minutes have been drafted for a completed meeting
- WHEN the secretary marks the minutes as "ready for review"
- THEN all meeting participants MUST receive a notification with a link to the draft minutes
- AND participants MUST be able to submit correction suggestions

#### Scenario: Approve board minutes digitally

- GIVEN draft minutes with tracked changes from reviewers
- WHEN the chair reviews and approves the minutes
- THEN the minutes status MUST change to "approved"
- AND the approved minutes MUST be locked against further editing
- AND the approval MUST be recorded with timestamp and approver identity

---

### Requirement: Minutes Document Generation

The system MUST support generating professional minutes documents via Docudesk. The minutes MUST include all meeting metadata, attendance, per-item discussions, decisions with voting results, and action items.

**Feature tier**: V1

#### Scenario: Generate minutes document from meeting data

- GIVEN an approved set of minutes
- WHEN the secretary triggers "Generate Document"
- THEN the system MUST send the minutes data to Docudesk for rendering
- AND the generated document MUST be stored in Nextcloud Files linked to the meeting
- AND the document MUST be available in PDF and ODT formats
